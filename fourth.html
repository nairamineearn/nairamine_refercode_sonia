<h3 style="color:black">This is how Naira Mine works. 
In the minimum registration of ₦1,000 
We have 100  members in a group of trading and all together is ₦100,000. Then we convert it to dollars and we have $241.89 we use it to trade in 15% and  the 89 will be use as trading charges in transaction
And at the end of the day we earn $277  that's = 116,772 Naira in a day trading.
Then after 3 days we share an amount of ₦500 airtime to 100 people that's =₦50,000. 
So when we repeat the trading in 7 days and  we end up getting $1,967 = ₦817,406 then we share ₦700,000 back to our members  and we keep ₦67,406.
We keep it because Sometimes in the trading process there can be loss and with that ₦67,406 will cover the loss and you guys will still get your cash back of ₦7,000


In this website  you don't have to stress yourself
